## PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using InDesign, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

#### INTERFACE 1st Draft: Wireframes    
Post to the #exercise-interface Slack channel in grayscale (includes black and white). 

* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder text at this stage.

#### INTERFACE 2nd Draft: High-Fidelity Wireframes  
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity wireframes in color
* Post to the #exercise-interface Slack channel

#### INTERFACE Final: Final Hi-Fidelity Prototype 
* Refine design based on feedback from your classmates and the professor as discussed in group critiques and one-on-one desk crits.
