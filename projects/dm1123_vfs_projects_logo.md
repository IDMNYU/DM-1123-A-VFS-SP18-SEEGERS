## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.

####Decide on your Brand, Organization, Company, etc.
* Select a 4-6 character combination of letters and/or numbers.
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo, an interface, and a physical application.
* write a few sentences describing the brand/organization/company, things like its name (is it an abbreviation for something, like NYU?), what it does, who its audience is, etc. Feel free to bring in more than one brand if you're not sure.

####LOGO 1st Draft  
* Post a multi-page PDF to the Slack channel #project-logo
* **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black & white)**
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions for a total of at least 20 images
  * A big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage stamp size) in the corner
* at least 3 should be digital
* at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise your different versions, play around with creating [icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos](http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html)


#### LOGO 2nd Draft  
* Post a multi-page PDF (export from Illustrator) to the Slack channel #project-logo
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is for to your wordpress post
* Choose 3 of your 10 previous design directions, and do **at least 5 different variations of logo** iterations in grayscale (black & white) or color, for a total of at least 15 iterations.
* One logo per letter dimensions ( 8 1/2 x 11) for a total of at least 15 pages
* (a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)

#### LOGO Final  
* Post a PDF (export from Illustrator) to the Slack channel #project-logo
* In order to come to your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version. I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
* **Final logo** in color and letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11) with a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
* Bring in as much of your process between your 2nd and final drafts as you feel is important to explain how you arrived at your final design.
  * **Process is just as important as final product!**
