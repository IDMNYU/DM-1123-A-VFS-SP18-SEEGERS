## PROJECT: PHYSICAL APPLICATION (PA)
Your final logo in color in a physical, applied state (i.e. poster, packaging, signage, apparel, business cards, stickers, etc.). Your choice for your logo’s applied state is up to you. You decide. There are literally hundreds of possible applied states. 

#### PA 1st Draft    
Post in the #project-physapp channel on Slack, in grayscale (includes black and white)

* Select 3 potential applied state for your one and true final logo
* For those selected applied states, do at least 3 different directions/designed applications of your logo
* In other words, if you are going to do a cd cover, do 3 different versions for a cd cover. If you are also thinking of doing a business card, also do 3 different versions of a business card. 
* Each version in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### PA 2nd Draft    
Post a PDF (exported from InDesign) in the #project-physapp channel on Slack

* Choose the version selected in the previous class crit.
* Select only 1 applied state (yes, this is repeated.)
* Do at least 3 different variations of the selected PA. 
* Each variation in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### PA Final    
Get your final physical application produced/fabricated at a service bureau of your choice, using the NYU maker space, or using your own ingenuity and craft.
